# Sensors and Senders

This example configuration demonstrates how sensor FMUs can be used to communicate with an external control system. The aim is to demonstrate how this might be configured using the OSP-IS configuration files and how sensor modelling can be separated from communication.

A general overview of the configuration is shown in Figure 1. The layers are not part of the configuration, but is meant to demonstrate the general philosophy behind the case.

The sensor layers covers FMUs responsible for generating sensor data. By sensor data is meant noise, unit conversions and logic. Noise might be disturbances introduced by the sensor; unit conversions, such as north-east-down to latitiude and lognitude; and logic, such as the number of satellites for the gps.

The communication layer covers FMUs whose sole responsibility is to convert their input into some communication protocol and transfer it to a destination. In this example the data protocol is NMEA and communication protocol UDP. However, we could have used another communication protocol such as serial, as long as the data protocol and interface stays the same. Meaning that the GPS sender implementing NMEA over UDP can be seamlessly switched with another sender implementing NMEA over serial. This is one of the advantages of separating data sources from communication.
