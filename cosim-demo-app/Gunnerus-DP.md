# Gunnerus-DP

The purpose of this demo case is to demonstrate separation of control systems and simulators in `libcosim` and the use of network FMUs.

This toplogy is common when performing hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations. In a HIL setup, the control system is deployed on production hardware and hooked up to an external simulator. The external simulator can be deployed to whatever hardware is available as long as it enables an interface compatible with the control system. The same toplogy can also be seen when running software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulations. SIL is typically used to test and verify system functionality and it is not a requirement that the control system is deployed to production hardware.

This demo case demonstrates that doing simulations with this kind of topology is feasible using `libcosim` and the OSP configuration format. The case simulates a DP controlled vessel performing a box maneuver while exposed to external forces. NTNU's research vessel, Gunnerus (Figure 1), has been used as reference for both the vessel and control plant.

## System Description

The HIL/SIL toplogy is emulated by splitting the simulation into two instances: one running the control system (Figure 2) and another running the simulator models (Figure 3). Each instance can run separately on different hardware. A single system configuration (Figure 4), where the control plant and simulator is executed in the same instance, is also provided.

The control system and simulator communicates using a network FMU, custom made for this demo. Each system instantiates a version with an interface for receiving and sending states. For instance, the network FMU in the control system sends thruster commands and receives vessel and environment states. The single system configuration does not use the network FMU.  

A list of all FMUs are given in Table 1.

## FMU Descriptions

### Box Reference Model

The box reference FMU generates setpoints for north, east and yaw. The model is shown in Figure 5 and the output in Figure 6. The result is a box maneuver which takes the vessel between 0-40m north and 0-40m east. The setpoints are not intended to be directly sent to the DP controller, but should be passed through a reference filter first.

### DP Controller

This FMU implements Gunnerus' DP control system. The control plant consists of proportional-derivative, integrator and reference feed forward parts, all of which can be independently enabled or disabled.

The controller inputs are the vesselâ€™s position in NED (North-East-Down), velocity in BODY, position setpoint in NED, velocity setpoint in BODY and acceleration setpoint in BODY. The acceleration setpoint is required if the reference feed-forward part of the model is enabled.

A complete list of inputs, outputs and tunables are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.

### Reference Model

The reference model provides smooth setpoint signals for the DP controller, ensuring a controlled and stable operation. The signals are based on the desired position provided by the box reference FMU.

A simulink representation of the model is shown in Figure 8 and its inputs and outputs are described in Table 8.

### Thruster Dynamics

This FMU implements simplified thruster dynamics as a low pass filter which can be enabled or disabled. The thruster command is mapped directly to forces acting on the vessel without considering thruster placement. This mapping is instantaneous if thruster dynamics are disabled. It is also possible to enable or disable thrust saturation.

The FMU is based on the simulink model shown in Figure 9 and its interface is described in Table 10.

| `EnableThrusterDynamics`    | True     | Enables or disables thruster dynamcis    |

### Vessel Model

This FMU implements vessel dynamics. Its interface is shown in Figure 10. The sum forces input has been split into wave forces and thrust and current velocity must be provided by an external simulation model. In this case the current model FMU. Based on these inputs the FMU produces vessel velocities and accelerations in the BODY frame as well as position in the NED frame.

Additional external forces can be connected to either the wave forces or thrust port. Internally, they are both connected to the same summation block. The current velocity port only considers the x and y components of the input vector. The rest of the entries can be set to zero.
The full list of inputs and outputs are shown in Table 10
