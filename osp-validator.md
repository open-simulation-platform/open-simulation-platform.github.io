# osp validator
The Model interface validator is a tool to verify that the simulation model complies to the [msmi]() specification. 
The validator loads the `OSPModelDescription.xml` and the [ontology](), and checks that the configuration is correct. It can be used to verify that a given FMU with an `OSPModelDescription.xml` complies to the msmi specification. And it can be used to verify that the connections between two FMUs are semantically correct.

Multi-variable connections: One of the main benefits of msmi is that it enables the implementation of multi-variable connections with simultaneous verification of semantic correctness. 
Today connection of two FMUs is a matter of connecting signal by signal,  as shown in Fig. 1, interpreting the signal names and deducing which connections are probably correct. 
Also, ensuring matching units might be a matter of consulting documentation, or possibly communication with the model developers.

With msmi it is possible to connect groups of signals simultaneously by grouping signals representing the same real-world phenomena into one connector, as shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, it is possible to implement automatic checking of semantic correctness. Which could be used to guide the person performing the connections, possibly by disabling invalid connections as shown in Fig. 3.
The unit part of the ontology is developed such that it is possible to check if two signals are of the same unit. If they are, they can be connected. If they are not it is possible to check if they can be converted to the same unit and then connected. If they can be converted, the conversion factors can be retrieved from the `OSPModelDescription.xml` and a conversion can be inserted.
