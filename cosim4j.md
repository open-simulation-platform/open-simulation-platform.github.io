# Java wrapper
The Java wrapper `cosim4j` enables Java applications to make use of `libcosim`.
It uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to efficiently interact with `libcosim`. 
To make it accessible, all native dependencies for Linux and Windows have been pre-built and are bundled with the library.
