### CSE core
The open-source software coined the Core Simulation Environment (CSE) produced in the OSP JIP consists of the following elements:

- C/C++ co-simulation library [cse-core v0.6.0](./cse-core/doxygen/0.6.0){:target="_blank"}
- Demo application [cse-server-go v0.6.0](./cse-server-go)
- Command-line interface
- Model interface validator
- CSE Java wrapper

[more details](./cse-core/cse)

#### CSE demo application
This is an application that demonstrates the features of cse-core. The intention is to show how cse-core can be used in an application and to provide a simple graphical user interface for easy exploration of the cse-core features.
